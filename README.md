# AgriSokoConnect_Frontend

Agrisoko-connect wants to empower farmers and create a system that is more open in order to transform Rwanda's agriculture industry.

Agrisoko-connect provides farmers a way to present their agricultural products to a wider audience. Through direct connections with buyers, they can potentially gain access to new markets and fetch better prices. Through improved communication and negotiation, the platform simplifies transactions and improves the efficiency of the purchasing process.
